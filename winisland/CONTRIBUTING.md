# Contribution Guide

English | [简体中文](CONTRIBUTING-zh.md)

Thank you for your interest in the WinIsland project! This document will help you understand how to contribute.

## 1. PR Contribution Scope

For non-project-members, your PR can cover the following areas:

1.1. Issues already labelled `accepted` — you may submit a PR for these.

1.2. Documentation, comments, code cleanups (e.g. fixing clippy warnings), minor UI tweaks, and other small, well-defined changes.

1.3. Feature PRs with a large diff (new features, refactoring core modules, etc.) require a detailed design proposal in the PR first; project members will then review it.

1.4. **Changelog**: Do not modify changelog files (`Changelog.md`, `Changelog-zh.md`) in your pull request. Only project maintainers are allowed to update these files.

⛔ For PRs that fall outside this scope, project members **have the right to reject them directly**.

> Our principle: **Any contribution should deliver more value to the project than the effort required to review it**. Please communicate with project members before starting work to avoid conflicting directions.
>
> (Of course, if there has already been discussion in an issue, feel free to jump right in :P Just let us know :D)

## 2. Development Environment Requirements

- **Rust**: 1.80+ (installation via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is recommended)
- **Git**: latest version
- **Windows**: WinIsland has a strong dependency on Windows APIs. Developing on Windows 10/11 (x86_64 or ARM64) is recommended.

After the initial clone, run:
```bash
cargo build
```

## 3. Code Standards

### 3.1 Rust Code Style

**3.1.1 Formatting**: Must be run before committing:
```bash
cargo fmt --all
```

**3.1.2 Linting**: All clippy checks must pass with no warnings allowed:
```bash
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
```

**3.1.3 Naming conventions**:
- File names: `snake_case` (e.g. `audio_capture.rs`)
- Functions/variables: `snake_case` (e.g. `get_media_info`)
- Structs/enums/traits: `PascalCase` (e.g. `MediaInfo`, `AudioProcessor`)
- Constants/statics: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g. `MAX_SAMPLE_RATE`)

**3.1.4 Comment conventions**:
- Complex logic or `unsafe` blocks require inline comments explaining the reasoning.
- Avoid meaningless comments (e.g. ones that simply repeat what the code says).

**3.1.5 Windows-specific**:
- All Win32 API calls must be wrapped inside `unsafe {}` blocks.
- Code involving windows, audio, or SMTC must pay attention to thread safety.

**3.1.6 Tests**:
- Do not add unit, integration, snapshot, or UI tests to this project.

### 3.2 Rendering (Skia)

- When modifying drawing logic in `src/core/render.rs`, ensure the Skia surface has been properly initialized.
- Drawing code should use the 2D APIs provided by `skia_safe`; do not manually write into pixel buffers.
- Adding new icons: define Skia paths under `src/icons/`; do not hardcode SVGs elsewhere.

### 3.3 Async Code

- All async tasks should be started with `tokio::spawn`, for example updaters and audio capture.
- When interacting with the winit event loop, use `tokio` channels or `winit::event_loop::EventLoopProxy` for cross-thread communication.

### 3.4 UI Guidelines
- All new/modified UI should follow Apple Design guidelines and maintain consistency with existing UI styles.

## 4. Git Workflow

### 4.1 Branch Naming

- `feat/feature-name` — new feature
- `fix/issue-description` — bug fix
- `refactor/task-description` — refactoring
- `chore/task-description` — chores (dependency updates, build config, etc.)
- `docs/documentation-description` — documentation updates

### 4.2 Commit Conventions

This project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Format:

```
<type>: <subject>
<type>(scope): <subject>
```

`type` must be lowercase and can be one of:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code formatting (no logic change)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A performance improvement
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies, etc.
- `ci`: CI configuration changes
- `revert`: Reverting a previous commit

**Examples**:
```
feat(smtc): support custom SMTC app filtering
fix(render): fix rounded corner drawing issue in extended mode
docs(contributing): supplement Skia rendering guidelines
```

### 4.3 Commit Checks

The repository has automated checks configured:

- `pre-commit`: runs `cargo fmt -- --check` to ensure correct formatting.
- `commit-msg`: validates that the commit message follows the Conventional Commits format.
- CI: runs clippy, format checks, and builds once more.

### 4.4 What if my commit is blocked?

1. `cargo fmt` fails → run `cargo fmt --all`, then `git add` again.
2. Commit message does not conform → rewrite it using the `<type>: description` format.
3. Run self-checks beforehand: `cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings && cargo build`

### 4.5 Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create a branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature
   ```

2. Develop and self-check:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
   cargo build --release   # ensure the release build succeeds
   ```

3. Commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -s -m "feat(scope): feature description"
   ```

4. Push your branch and open a PR.
    - Keep the PR title concise (≤70 characters). The description should include a summary of changes, testing instructions, and related issues.
    - If you changed configuration items (`config.rs`), describe backward compatibility.

## 5. Code Review Standards

### 5.1 Must Meet

- ✅ All CI checks pass
- ✅ `cargo fmt` produces no diff
- ✅ `cargo clippy` produces no warnings (`-D warnings`)
- ✅ `cargo build --release` succeeds
- ✅ Feature is complete and does not break existing SMTC monitoring or window behavior
- ✅ `unsafe` blocks have adequate justification and their safety has been reviewed

### 5.2 Should Meet

- Adequate comments and documentation
- If there are UI changes, provide screenshots or describe animation effects (spring parameters, etc.)

## 6. FAQ

### 6.1 How do I run WinIsland?
```bash
cargo run --package WinIsland --bin WinIsland --profile dev
```
> Note: Only one instance can run at a time (protected by a Windows mutex).

### 6.2 Too many clippy warnings?
```bash
cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty
```

### 6.3 How do I test audio visualization?
- Play any audio that SMTC can recognize.
- Check whether `src/core/audio.rs` behaves correctly (you can add temporary print statements during development).

## 7. Code of Conduct

- Respect all contributors, and remain kind and professional.
- Accept constructive feedback.
- Help new contributors understand Windows APIs and Skia usage.
